The Chandler Police Department was investigating a minor injury collision involving a self-driving vehicle Friday afternoon. According to police, a Honda sedan driving eastbound on Chandler Boulavard near Chandler Fashion Center swerved to avoid another vehicle and struck a Waymo autonomous vehicle traveling in the opposite direction. The Waymo vehicle was traveling at a slow speed and in autonomous mode. The operator in the driver¡¯s seat sustained minor injuries. Police said the self-driving vehicle was not at fault. ¡°The Waymo vehicle is not the violator vehicle. It just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,¡± Chandler police detective Seth Tyler told Phoenix New Times. Two months ago, an Uber autonomous vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe. Uber suspended its self-driving vehicle testing after that incident. The head of Waymo, formerly Google¡¯s driverless car project, said at the time his company¡¯s technology could have avoided that accident.
