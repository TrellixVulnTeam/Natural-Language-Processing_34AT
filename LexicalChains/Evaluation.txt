Example text 2:
The Chandler Police Department was investigating a minor injury collision involving a self-driving vehicle Friday afternoon. According to police, a Honda sedan driving eastbound on Chandler Boulavard near Chandler Fashion Center swerved to avoid another vehicle and struck a Waymo autonomous vehicle traveling in the opposite direction. The Waymo vehicle was traveling at a slow speed and in autonomous mode. The operator in the driver’s seat sustained minor injuries. Police said the self-driving vehicle was not at fault. “The Waymo vehicle is not the violator vehicle. It just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Chandler police detective Seth Tyler told Phoenix New Times. Two months ago, an Uber autonomous vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe. Uber suspended its self-driving vehicle testing after that incident. The head of Waymo, formerly Google’s driverless car project, said at the time his company’s technology could have avoided that accident.

It works well to connect some relevant words like "single" and "one", "attempt" and "try". But the connection of "people" and "land" or "technology" and "it" may not be very reasonable. Besides, it should be more reasonable to group "people", "child" and "adult" into one chain.


2.Evaluation for summarizer:
Every chain is given a score according the size of words. If one sentence contains the word of one chain, it will be added the corresponding score. Finally, extract the top 30% sentences as summary.

Use the example 1, the result is:
A single engine airplane crashed Tuesday into a ditch beside a dirt road on the outskirts of Albuquerque, killing all five people aboard authorities said.

Use the example 2, the result is:
The Chandler Police Department was investigating a minor injury collision involving a self-driving vehicle Friday afternoon. 
According to police, a Honda sedan driving eastbound on Chandler Boulavard near Chandler Fashion Center swerved to avoid another vehicle and struck a Waymo autonomous vehicle traveling in the opposite direction. 
The Waymo vehicle was traveling at a slow speed and in autonomous mode. 

It works fine to extract the most important sentences.
